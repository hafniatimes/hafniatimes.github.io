Style Manual
============
The site generally follows the Oxford style, with exceptions.

As with unit testing for code, a good habit is to add an entry for each problem you run into.

Technology
----------

:---------------------------|:------------

* **Broadband** is a minimum speed of 25 Mb/s download and 3 Mb/s upload as [defined by the FCC][broadband].

Capitalization
--------------
 Right                        | Wrong
:-----------------------------|:-----------
 Prime Minister such-and-such | (Lowercase)
 The prime minister           | (Uppercase)
 President such-and-such      | (Lowercase)
 The president                | (Uppercase)
 Pope such-and-such           | (Lowercase)
 The pope                     | (Uppercase)
 Democrat(ic), Republican, Conservative | (Lowercase)
 Muslim, Jew(ish), Christian  | (Lowercase)
 secretary general            | (Uppercase)

Monolithic concepts like “Internet” and “Technology” are capitalized, partly as a deterrent to using them as big, fluffy concepts.

Companies
---------
 Right | Wrong
:------|:-----
 LEGO  | Lego

Finance
-------
 Right          | Wrong
:---------------|:-----
 Nationalbanken, Denmark’s Nationalbank | The Danish (...), The Central Bank of Denmark
 Riksbanken, Sweden’s Riksbank          | The Swedish (...), The Central Bank of Sweden
 (the) ECB | The European Central Bank, Europe’s Central Bank

Currency
--------
All currencies are uncapitalized.

 Right                     | Wrong
:--------------------------|:------------------------------------
 (Danish) krone(r), DKK    | (Danish) kroners
 (Norwegian) krone(r), NOK | (Danish) kroners
 (Swedish) krona/-or, SEK  | (Swedish) kroner, (Swedish), kronors
 (Swiss) franc(s), CHF     |
  euro                     |  euros
 (US) dollar(s)            | (US) Dollar(s)

Using the currency symbols is preferable; “$1,500”, “1,500 kr.” vs “1,500 US dollars”, “1,500 Danisk kroner”.

Use the unabbreviated currency the first time, and the abbreviation for repeat uses.

Acronyms/Abbreviations
----------------------
Use Markdown’s [abbreviation syntax][abbr] in the following cases:

 Shorthand  | Full Word
:-----------|:----------------------------------
 MEPs       | members of the European Parliament
 MPs        | members of parliament

Immigrant vs Expatriot
----------------------
Use **immigrants** in general and avoid **expatriots**.

You can use **expatriots** to draw an explicit distinction between immigrants who intend permanent residence to a expatriots whose future residency plans are significantly more ambiguous.

Reporting on Politics
---------------------
Be sure to distinguish between:

* Majorities of votes (ie a majority of the popular vote)
* Majorities of seats in parliament (ie an electoral majority)

Refrain from using “supermajority” and “absolute majority”, when you are in fact just describing a basic majority of seats.

In Britain, parties can gain a majority of seats without a majority of votes. Do not call this majority of seats an absolute majority; absolute majorities and supermajorities are for circumstances that require more than 50% of seats in parliament.

### US Politics ###

Be wary of sentences akin to “Congress does `X`”. In many cases, it is actually only one of the two chambers, the Senate and the House that block or pass measures in the news, meaning that the bill has in fact neither been passed or blocked.

Furthermore, only write that “the Senate/House does `X`”, when both parties vote across partisan lines with a similar ratio of Aye/Nay votes. Otherwise, write that “Republicans/Democrats do `X` in the Senate/House”.

Essentialism
------------
Avoid nouns defining people by traits, and generally nounified adjectives:

 Preferred                           | Not Preferred
:------------------------------------|:-----------------
 black and Asian people              | blacks and Asians
 gay and lesbian people              | gays and lesbians
 homo-, bi-, and heterosexual people | homo-, bi-, and heterosexuals
 illegal( immigrant)s                | people living [somewhere] illegally
 men, women                          | males, females

Be particularly careful with referring to people “victims”.

By using an adjective rather than a noun for your description, you describe a trait instead of defining an identity.
