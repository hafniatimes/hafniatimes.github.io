### You Know What We Stand For ###

When a Danish high school class {on} Bornholm manages, in such a manner, with a small, quickly shot video can capture who Danish People's Party is, and what it is about, there is ample reason to hope for a good, great, and bright future for Denmark!

I of course already saw the video at Folkemødet {on} Bornholm this summer during the election. Already then, I was touched and impressed.<br />Touched because I could feel Danish People's Party, I could feel us all and our politics, in that little video.<br />And impressed because the capable students *so* quickly and *so* effectively captured and presented what Danish People's Party actually is.

Those students in that high school class ... They know what we stand for.

* * * *

There hasn't been much to be cheerful about the last couple of weeks. Sometimes it just plain sucks (...) to be right.

For a long time, we have said that the, frankly, careless and irresponsible handling of the border control around Europe would result in catastrophes.<br />It has! Unfortunately, we were right.

For even longer, we have said that scrapping the Danish border control in 2001 was indefensible and would cause problems.<br />
There, too, have we been proven more right than we {are comfortable with}!

And finally, we've been saying for a long time that the aid to the {nærområder}[^nærområder] people are fleeing from should be increased.

[^nærområder]: In the English translation of [the PM's New Year's speech][nye16], the phrase "[location] close to their native country" is used.

{I'll get back to all that.}

But first of all, a warm welcome to Danish People's Party's annual party conference here at Jyske Bank Boxen!

It is a new and different setting for us.

This place has room for 15,000 happy concertgoers and has been the venue for concerts with names such as Lady Gaga and Elton John.

Roars of celebration have also been heard, when both the female and male handball teams have played. And the craziest is. The place where you are sitting right now was filled with water in December 2013{, as the European Championship} was held. You might coyly ask why Danish Radio couldn't use this arena for the international {Eurovision}. That might have saved them some money.

When we had to figure out whether we could hold our anniversarial annual conference here, the place was filled with sand and dirt and roaring {motorbikes}. The Super 2015 was to be held. What a place!

We don't *quite* have 15,000, and we didn't bring motorbikes in here.<br />
Somewhere outside by Skagenshusene, by the café area might have some sand ...

But! We are 1,600 participants strong this year! It's not just a record, It's [sic] overwhelming.

In fact, we're 1,657 today including the press.

(...)

* * * *

First of all, Europe needs to secure and control its outer borders!

There are those who tell us it can't be done.. [sic]<br />
There are those who tell us we {don't have the right}.<br />
Journalists who report from the border of Hungary as if border cops are villains and bandits, and stone-throwing youths are {heroic freedom fighters}.

<span>UN's Ban Ki Moon who accuses Hungary of treating people unacceptably. Is it the stone-throwing youths he's thinking of? Let me make it clear: you can accuse Hungary of many things. But they won't receive any critique for securing their borders from here. Every country has the right to defend its borders and decide who to open the doors for!</span>{: .highlight}

EU's and thereby Denmark's challenges basically come from two things:

*First* the national border controls were stopped almost 15 years ago.<br />
In return, people agreed to strong outer border controls by Europe's borders.<br />
In Danish People's Party we already knew in 2001 that it was just {hand-waving}.<br />
It wouldn't work.<br />
And indeed it hasn't. And now the problems are {overwhelming} Europe.

<span>*The other* cause is German and is named Chancellor Angela Merkel.</span>{: .highlight}

Two weeks ago, Merkel decided to open the border Germany's borders wide open.<br />
But Germany knew that a part of the challenge was passed on to other countries---including Denmark.<br />
Because many of the people who came to Germany weren't registered.<br />
Germany therefore bears a large responsibility by signalling with its zig-zag course to every person who wants to go to Europe that the door has now been left wide open; [sic]

Actual refugees in need---but unfortunately also people who just want to exchange poor living conditions in the Middle East or North Africa for a better existence in Scandinavia. It's obviously hard to blame these people for living with the dream, but it is the not the way forward, and we need to put our foot down.

Therefore, secondly, Denmark needs to reintroduce border controls. And time is of the essence!

I've heard the other parties almost taking turns chanting that "border control doesn't work", so it's not "the way to go", as they say.

But what do they want, then?

When we suddenly see {hordes}[^hob] people who refuse to be registered and yel that they don't want to be there.

[^hob]: The Danish word used is "hob"---not "hord".

<span>And we know that some of them are picked up by immigrant[^indvandrer] gangs...</span>{: .highlight}

[^indvandrer]: This is translated from "indvandrer", which technically is Danish for "immigrant", but colloquially refers to brown people, native citizens or not.

Let me put it like this: it has not been pretty to observe that foreigners[^udlændinge], in the right numbers and with the right amount of pressure at the border, can force the {police leadership} and a government to {hesitate}.[^danish-handling]

[^udlændinge]: Like "immigrant", "foreigner" in Danish is also code or colloquial for the same type of person, technical definitions notwithstanding.

[^danish-handling]: This refers to how Danish parties on all sides did and said little to nothing, when the refugees and migrants first started arriving in Denmark. The police were left to handle the situation themselves, and eventually just allowed refugees to walk to Sweden---[Dublin Regulation][] or not.

And it hasn't been pretty to hear that "everything was handled by the book" and whatever else the administration has said about that.

The thing is that what has happened for years since Denmark's {Schengen membership of 2001} suddenly became {extra} visible, because it involved so many in so little time. And now they've just stopped halting the trains by the border[^trains], so the stream of people isn't a daily news story. Now the topic is something else---but the problem remains the same.

[^trains]: During the first days of the new wave of refugees and migrants, the authorities were reluctant to allow people to travel to Sweden by train, in part because it could be considered people-smuggling. They soon changed their mind to allow them to pass through.

<span>{At The Social Democrats'}, party leader Mette Frederiksen has largely been silent and flown under the radar as much as possible. It seems as if she's thinking: "Hah, [PM] Løkke's got a problem! He'll have to sort that out himself."<br />
{Her call.} If this is modern responsbility to the Social Democrats in the Autumn of 2015, {that's her call}. But not a whole lot of proposals for solutions have been seen from that camp!</span>{: .highlight}

It's become so modern in politics to say that you *clearly* want something or other.<br />
So I want to {say *clearly*}, so it can be heard in Aalborg, where the Social Democrats are congregated these days:

Dear Mette Frederiksen. It was *you* who removed the border control[^border-control] that we for years past had agreed to reintroduce with the Venstre-Konservative administration at the time.

[^border-control]: {TODO}

It was *you* who boasted that it was practically the first thing you did after the election in 2011.

It was *you* whose policy resulted in multiple foreigners[^udlændinge] to come here on your watch over the last four years, one of the reasons being the significantly higher benefits for whose who came here.

You have a responsibility. There is a bill to be footed. So the time hasn't come to fly under the radar. The time is to face Your [sic] responsibility!

I hope you now see how Germany, of all!---and Holland and Poland---with more on the way --- have tightened the border control that there is a clear Danish interest in reintroducing Danish border control.[^dashes]

[^dashes]: Mr Kristian Thulesen Dahl is a fan of parenthetical thinking, so you'll see cases of m-dashes nested inside em dashes. I use em dashes without surrounding spaces in general, and em dashes *with* surrounding spaces, when they go inside em dashes.

Even in today's Parliament in the wake of a few weeks of experience with {extra pressure} on the border, Danish People's Party is still the only party on [parliament building] Christiansborg that insists on border control. <span>And even we are 37 MPs against 142[^parliament]---a slightly uneven fight---we press on.</span>{: .highlight}

[^parliament]: Danish parliament has 179 seats total. DPP have 37.

And you know what? I think {time is working in our favour}.

And that's why I can calmly promise you and our many voters from Jne: What we meant before the election---even on this subject---we will mean that here on the other side of the election as well:

And that means that we won't stop working to reintroduce border control, until it's accomplished. We WILL have control at Denmark's borders[^borders]!

[^borders]: Keep in mind that the only border by mainland is with Germany at South Judland. Other than that, the Øresund Bridge carries people between Copenhagen and Malmö, Sweden.

    The [mainland border between Denmark and Germany is **68 km**][mainland] (42 mi); [Denmark's coastline is **8,750 km**][coastline] (5,437 mi)---or 7,413 (4606 mi) depending on the methodology.

But we also need to do more than that!

* * * *

<span>We want Denmark to COMPLETELY {revamp} our asylum policy.[^asyl]<br />
We want to do that fundamentally and comprehensively. We need to rethink it.</span>{: .highlight} It's good that we've dealt with parts of the foreigner policy[^told-ya]. Amongst other things, we've lowered the benefits you get when you arrive in Denmark. <span>But we need to keep going!</span>{: .highlight}

[^asyl]: Asylum policy, like foreigner, immigrant, refugee, and integration policy, is basically used interchangeably.
[^told-ya]: See?

For this reason, {I took last week} to encouraging a national compromise on how we help <span>actual refugees</span>{: .highlight} for the money we spend while <span>ensuring the safe-keeping of the Denmark we know</span>{: .highlight}.

<span>A Denmark that's safe for all Danes.<br />
A Denmark for the foreigners we ourselves choose to admit, and who can contribute to a positive development of Denmark.<br />
A Denmark where we continue to have resources for care and support, where we have resources to develop our core welfare for the sick and elderly and vulnerable. Where there is safety!.[^safety]</span>{: .highlight}

[^safety]: My Danish-to-English dictionary does a good job of explaining the Danishness of the Danish word for *"safety"*, *"tryghed"*, with its three suggestions:

    * security
    * safety
    * comfort

    The last point is important, because the aspect of comfort comports with the Danish concept of **"hygge"**---having a good time keeping to your own devices, doing something or nothing by yourself or others close to you.

    See [BBC][] and [Visit Denmark][] on the concept of hygge. Visit Denmark use the word "cosiness", which is important to the idea of safety and the factors that threatens to upset the blissful status quo.

<span>This is why Danish People's Party are here:<br />
To keep Denmark Danish.<br />
To preserve the welfare society generations before us have built.<br />
To preserve a society where we can fundamentally walk in safety and trust each other.</span>{: .highlight}

For a number of years, there has been a counterproductive conflation of immigration policy and asylum policy. Refugees staying temporarily have been treated as immigrants---they've been given three-year immigration programs, courses in Danish, and a legal right to housing[^housing].<br />
All of it's been {helped along} by parties and {employers' associations} who believe that refugees would be an amazing contribution to the labour market.

[^housing]: The "legal right to housing" is actually a *human right to adequate housing* pursuant to **Article 25 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights][udhr]**:

    > (1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.

    For more on this, read this [UN fact sheet on housing][] and this [NESRI article on the protections enshrining the right to adequate housing][nesri].

But that's not how it works in the real world!

For the numbers we know refute this: a survey from the Confederation of Danish Employers (DA) from March shows that among the Syrians who've immigrated to Denmark for the last couple of years, only 13 per cent are actually employed after 4 years in Denmark, while Iraqis and Iranians' job frequency is actually a tad higher. The job frequency of <span>the Danes</span>{: .highlight}, meanwhile, is around 80 ...

And all focus has been on integration, not for them to head home, when the opportunity is actually there.

{That's no good!}

<span>Refugees who've come here should not be itnegrated, they should not be put in years-long integration courses---and their legal right to housing --- which means that they skip the queue on housing---should be removed.</span>{: .highlight}

Refugees who come to Denmark should go home as soon as the conditions in their home countries and {nærområder} allow it. For some, this will happen fast, for others, it <span>can</span>{: .highlight} take years.

<span>While they're in Denmark, then must live in asylum centres run by the state.</span>{: .highlight}

<span>The municipalities are hard-pressed as it is. Additional costs for housing and integration are squeezing the municipalities' ability to help the Danes who need help ..</span>{: .highlight}

<span>If we go ahead with the change that we're proposing, we ensure that refugees know that they can find shelter here in Denmark from persecution, war, and destruction. But they *can't* get lasting residence, they won't become a part of Denmark, our country is not a new, lasting destination for them.</span>{: .highlight}

<span>We don't know whether the developing situation means we'll get more refugees for a while. But if our change is passed, it's probably doubtful.</span>{: .highlight}

When the new reality dawns on the people-smugglers[^menneskesmugler] and the people, who aren't actually fleeing, but taking advantage of the existing refugee situation to replace a dismal and difficult life in Africa of the Middle East with a better one in Denmark, they'll probably not try to come here. It doesn't seem to be temporary protection these people are looking for, even though it would probably be desireable enough for many refugees.[^real-refugees]

[^menneskesmugler]: "Menneskesmugler", "people-smuggler", is a popular turn of phrase in Danish politics. It makes it easier to create a villain in the story of displacement and strife who profits from the situation.

    Better to focus on them than the refugees.

[^real-refugees]: Kristian Thulesen Dahl's speech employs two dichotomies with one villain and one victim:

    1. *Refugees* versus *sick, elderly, and vulnerable Danes*
    2. *People-smugglers and opportunistic migrants* versus *Actual Refugees*

    The logic is this:

    1. The first dichotomy casts refugees as the burdensome villain.
    2. The second dichotomy of fake sympathy is an act of obfuscation to abnegate the concept of an Actual Refugee; it reduces refugees to a Platonic ideal to which they can only aspire at best.

    "Refugees are a burden---not that we've seen any actual refugees."

And I assume it's allowed to ask for how long someone should be considered a refugee? If you travel through five to six secure countries to make it to Scandinavia. Perhaps having stayed in one of these countries for a number of years. Does that make you a refugee when you arrive in Denmark by the end? No---not {in my view}!

And while we in this country are focusing on those arriving here, we're leaving millions of actual refugees behind who have have no money to pay people smugglers, but who are sitting with their families in refugee camps in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon.<br />
Camps where the UN inexplicably[^inexplicable] have cut drastically on the support for food coupons.

[^inexplicable]: There is explicable about the UN cutting costs; there is [an enormous shortfall of foreign aid][aid], in part by countries who have yet to deliver on their pledges. After the 2015 election and this speech, [Danish People's Party ended up cutting Danish foreign aid][dkaid].

The people in the camps are going to starve.<br />
Those who arrive here with trains and taxis ask as one of the first things for power for their iPhones ...

It was with this paradox in midn that I last week encouraged the rest of Parliament to a national compromise parties across the aisle came agreed on both a new, tighter asylum policy as well as significantly more money for {nærområderne}. In fact so much that:

Denmark will become the world's biggest contributor to {nærområderne}!

<span>It's part of our Danish set of values to help people in need. We Danes have always done that. It has also always been the policy of Danish People's Party.</span>{: .highlight}

This is why we should increase the aid to {nærområderne}!<br />
We would like for Denmark to become---relative to its size---one of the world's biggest contributors.[^biggest-contributor]

[^biggest-contributor]: [Denmark is *already* one of the world's biggest contributors in foreign aid][oda-gni]. [FTS][] doesn't have data for Denmark's contributions to {nærområderne}, but the governing coalition have only cut foreign aid, since they won the election.

    Furthermore, they have reallocated a lot of the foreign aid to pay for the refugee situation back at home. As a matter of fact, *[Denmark is now the biggest recipient of its own foreign aid][biggest-recipient]*.

*That* will make it clear that we are serious. It will show that when we change the conditions for people who come here---stop integrating [them] and instead help temporarily---yes, then we'll increase the aid to {nærområderne} significantly in return. And that will Denmark clout in the UN and EU and with very wealthy oil states in not just suggesting, but *demanding* that they increase the aid!

And then things will really start rolling!

We help the most by helping them where most people already are.<br />
In their home countries or in {nærområderne}.<br />
<span>Whether we help seven, 10 or 20 more on the [dollar] by helping them there and not here is frankly immaterial. That's a fight over numbers you argue about for a long time</span>{: .highlight}.

<span>But that it's *a lot more* that we'll be helping for each [dollar] used is beyond any doubt.</span>{: .highlight}

<span>And once for all, let's stop with making this a discussion about whether you're good or evil. Whether you're loving thy neighbour.</span>{: .highlight}

The Red-Greens, Socialist People's Party, and Social Liberals can fight amongst themselves about who's the purest in the eyes of the Lord, and who most swiftly and effectively can <span>devastate</span>{: .highlight} Denmark socially, politically, culrurally, and economically by opening their arms and inviting everyone up here---refugees and migrants among them.<br />
{"C'mon-over!"}

While they fight, I suggest that all other parties solve this in a way that both secures Denmark and the Danes for the future and effectively helps more of the people <span>who are in need</span>{: .highlight}.

<span>Help in {nærområderne}. Works. If anyone had any doubt, [weekly newspaper] Weekendavisen documented it in an article[^wa] last Friday. A report from two universities in Great Britain and the US documents that refugees both stay in {områderne}, when sufficient aid is there, and that the welfare of {områderne} improves---even after peace has been restored, the camps have been shut down, and the Red Cross have gone home.</span>{: .highlight}

[^wa]: {}

<span>That has to be what you call a win-win-win situation :)</span>{: .highlight} [sic]

* * * *

We have to ensure that the society that was handed over to us by previous generations, and which we value so deeply, is preserved and <span>defended</span>{: .highlight}.

This can only be dine if we secure both a strong {business community} who can {earn the money back} while being careful with how we spend the money.

And with regards to the first, let me make it clear that to the Danish People's Party, there is no doubt whatsoever that we need to ensure good {conditions} for growth and production.

We must ensure that entrepreneurs think it's fun to kick things off in Denmark. That you are not overburdened by administrative requirements, and that you can get financing.

And we need to
