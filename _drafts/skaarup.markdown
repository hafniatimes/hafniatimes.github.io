Good morning everyone!

What a party we had yesterday. And how many we were! I've said it before. But I'll gladly say it again: no one paries better than DPPs!

It was an amazingly delightful party yesterday. And the party is a staple. Yes, we obviously need to use the yearly conference to talk politics and exchange political ideas with each other. But we also need to remember the social aspect and make time to talk to each other in informal settings.

Now, it also lights the mood that we have much to celebrate. At last year's conference, I sayd that it was the biggest party conference every. I can---happily---repeat that statement this year. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the BIGGEST annual party conference in the history of Danish People's Party!

Yes, it has in every way been a historic year for Danish People's Party. We celebrate our 20-year anniversary. It has been a long journey. A challenging one. And a thriling journey through the last 20 years. A journey that has offered many experiences. Experiences that we have shared together as a fellowship[^fellowship]. And that very fellowship is one of the reasons the party |står så stærkt| today.

[^fellowship]: Fellowship, community, any group that is united or together. Direct translation is along the lines of "togetherness".

Ladies and gentlemen: never before has DPP received as many vote at an election. Let's give ourselves a round of applause, because we have a fellowship and vision that made this possible!

But, ladies and gentlemen, dear DPPs, the party actually doesn't end here.

Because I believe that we in DPP are becoming a completely new and |creative| force in the Danish democracy.

<mark>We are neither completely blue nor completely read.</mark> We are balanced and work on solutions that are just in a society that simply doesn't have unlimited resources. I said it during the election, and I'll say it now: <mark>it's about safety and trust</mark>[^safety-and-trust].

[^safety-and-trust]: The statement can also be read as "it |comes down to| safety and trust", as if the two are the main foundation.

Dear ladies and gentlemen, I sense the outline of a Danish People's Party that is on its way to become Danish politics' third force. We create the balance between red and blue.

We work to provide sensible, balanced solutions. Solutions that keep the Danish fellowship intact.
